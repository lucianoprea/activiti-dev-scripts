# Scripts for Activiti Development

Clone-all to clone all Activiti 7 projects.
Build-all to build all of them, including creating docker images from local maven.
Start-docker-compose to start docker setup from the locally-built images.

These scripts can be used to set up an Activiti environment. To do so you’ll want to copy the scripts or if you clone this project then disconnect from git before running (git remote remove origin). 

This project is not officially maintained by the Activiti team - if anyone spots any problems let me know and I’ll endeavor to fix them.
