# Scripts for Activiti Development

Clone-all to clone all Activiti 7 projects.
Build-all to build all of them, including creating docker images from local maven.
Test-all to run all the tests on all projects, if desired (warning - will take a while).
Start-docker-compose to start docker setup from the locally-built images.
Stop-docker-compose to stop docker containers started by start-docker-compose.

These scripts can be used to set up an Activiti environment. To do so you’ll want to copy the scripts or if you clone this project then disconnect from git before running (rm -rf .git). 

This project is not officially maintained by the Activiti team - if anyone spots any problems let me know and I’ll endeavor to fix them.
